# Symbolic Ledger

## Introduction

Symbolic Ledger is a mathematical model of a layer 2 ledger that possesses exceptional scaling capabilities. The model includes data types and validation rules for the ledger state, transactions, and blocks. As it is implemented in the zkFold Symbolic framework, any statement about the ledger can be naturally expressed as a Haskell (zkFold Symbolic) function and converted to an arithmetic circuit for use in a ZKP protocol.
