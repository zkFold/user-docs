# About zkFold

zkFold is developing scaling solutions for blockchains, zero knowledge proof (ZKP) infrastructure and development tools. To achieve this goal, we use novel approaches to distributed system design and base our products on the state-of-the-art ZKP algorithms.

Our core team consists of talented developers and researchers who are passionate about distributed ledger technology (DLT) and zero knowledge cryptography. The team's expertise spans a wide range of fields, including cryptography, formal methods, game theory, distributed systems, and programming languages.
